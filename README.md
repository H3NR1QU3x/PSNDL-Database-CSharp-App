# PSNDL Database C# App

So, one of the best-known PSN content download sites was shut down. But not everything is over because they released their database, and I had a great idea to use their database for something.

## Installation

Installation is very simple, I don't use setups, I think it's a waste of time. So to download just download by zip.
The .exe is located just right here. So you don't have to clone or something like that.

## Usage
To use it is very simple. Just search the game by NAME, not its Title ID. And hit Download PKG and RAP to use on your PS3 or RPCS3.
